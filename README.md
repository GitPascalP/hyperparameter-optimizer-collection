# hyperparameter-optimizer-collection
A small collection of newly implemented hyperparameter optimization algorithms, as well as the use of already implemented algorithms The implementation aims at an application in reinforcement learning, but can easily be adapted for a more general use.

The easiest way to get a working toolbox is, installing:

- the bayesian-optimization toolbox: 

    ```pip install bayesian-optimization ``` https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization
- tensorforce version 0.5.5: 

    ``` pip install Tensorforce==0.5.5```
    https://tensorforce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    
and eventually adding the path from the "hyperparameter-optimizer-collection" to the 
python path to provide no problems with importing files within the toolbox.


Notes:
   
This Version is under construction. In the near future a structure 
corresponding to the python packaging conventions will be provided. 

Additional optimization algorithm could be added in the future.
